Governance
************************

FOINIX holders control the ecosystem and receive the majority of farm performance fee profits. In order to claim these profits, FOINIX holders stake their tokens in the FOINIX Governance Pool. Profits are sent to this pool in the form of BNB rewards. The amount of profits you receive is determined by the number of FOINIX tokens you stake (% of the pool) you own. We currently have a snapshot voting page where users can use FOINIX to vote on decisions within our community. Thus the more FOINIX you stake, the higher your influence in the ecosystem. In the future, we expect to come up with a more concrete governance tokenomics ecosystem, perhaps by introducing a new, separate governance token.
